So, in python, inheritance allows us to create a new class that is similar to an existing class, but with new or additional features. The new class is called a derived class or a subclass, and the existing class is called a base class or a superclass. To use inheritance, we write the name of the base class in parentheses after the name of the derived class when defining the class.",resources:["https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance","https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm"]},{name:"Polymorphism",language:"Python",name_and_language:"Polymorphism - Python",explanation:"Polymorphism means that different objects can be treated the same, even if they have different types.

The make_bold function takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that adds <b> and </b> tags around the output of the original function. The make_italic function does the same thing, but adds <i> and </i> tags instead. The hello function is decorated with both make_bold and make_italic using the @ symbol. This means that when the hello function is called, the output of the function is passed to the make_italic decorator first, which adds the <i> and </i> tags. Then, the output of the make_italic function is passed to the make_bold decorator, which adds the <b> and </b> tags. Finally, we call the hello function and print the output, which shows that the function has been decorated with both make_bold and make_italic decorators and the output is displayed with both bold and italic styles. So, in Python, decorators allow us to add new behavior to a function or a class by wrapping the original behavior in a new function.

Finally, we use the next function to get the next fruit from the iterator. The first time we call next, it returns "apple". The second time it returns "banana", and the third time it returns "cherry". If we try to call next again, it will raise a StopIteration error, which means that there are no more items in the list.
